These are basic instructions - to be improved on.
The game is designed to be playable on both PC and Oculus Quest 2 headset
So each ability has two implementations

Movement: WASD / LH joystick
Jump: Space / LH primary
Grappling Hook: RMB / LH trigger button 
Fire gun: LBM / RH trigger button
Switch Projectile: Q / RH secondary
Reload: E / RH primary
Create a building: F / LH secondary
Pause game: T / LH menu

Goal of the game: Move from rooftop to rooftop, track down the moving
monolith, and stop it before it completes its journey! By blowing up
buildings with your rocket launcher, damage it on collision with debris.
Shoot down enemy drones with your pistol. Build more buildings from
collected debris to jump on / blow up.

On PC: X to lose health, C to gain health.
